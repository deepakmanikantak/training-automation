     * The below are the method ref(1,2,3) in which stream api concept has been used it is the feature of java 1.8
     * in which instead of using cursors we are using lamda expressions which helps us to reduce the code
     * the methods we use are:
     * stream()---->stream is a method which is present in java.util.stream.Collectors
     *              A stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure.
     *              It also never modifies the underlying data source
     *              This functionality – java.util.stream – supports functional-style
     *              operations on streams of elements,
     *              such as map-reduce transformations on collections.
     *
     * map() -------->produces a new stream after applying a function to each element
     *              of the original stream.
     *       -------->Basically when we use map() is when we want to perform any kind of
     *                changes to our elements of collections then we need to go for
     *                map().
     *
     * filter()------>this produces a new stream that contains elements of the original stream
     *                 that pass a given test.
     *         ------->in this method we give conditions the elements which satisfy those
     *                 condtions are filtered out.
     *
     * collect()------>it is used to get elements out of the stream once we are done
     *                  with all the processing.
     *          -------> this operation is provided via the Collector interface implementation.
     *
     * sorted()-------->this method is used to sort the elements in ascending or descending order
     *                  using compareTo method(i1.compareTo(i2)) which is used to compare one element
     *                  with other and sort it accordingly.
